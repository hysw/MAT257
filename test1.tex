\subsection{Basic topology of metric spaces}
\begin{description}
\item[norm] $p:V\to\bR$\hfill\\
	For all $a\in F$ and all $u,v\in V$
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $p(v) \geq 0 \wedge [p(v) = 0 \iff v=0]$ (separates points)
	\item $p(av)=|a|p(v)$ (absolute homogeneity)
	\item $p(u + v) \leq p(u) + p(v)$ (triangle inequality)
	\end{itemize}
\item[inner product] $\langle x,y\rangle : V\times V \to \bR$\hfill\\
	For all $x,y,z \in V$ and $c\in\bF$.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\langle x,y\rangle = \langle y,x\rangle$
	\item $\langle x+y,z\rangle = \langle x,z\rangle + \langle y,z\rangle$
	\item $\langle cx,y\rangle = c\langle x,y\rangle = \langle x,cy\rangle$
	\item $\langle x,x\rangle > 0$ if $x\neq 0$
	\end{itemize}
\item[distance functions]$d: X \times X \to \bR$ \hfill\\
	For all $x, y, z \in X$
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $d(x, y)\geq 0$
	\item $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x=y$
	\item $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$
	\item $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$
	\end{itemize}
\item[open and closed subsets of metric spaces]\hfill\\
	open: every point is a interior point \newline
	closed: iff contains all its limit point
\item[closure]
	the set with all its limit points
\item[interior]
	union of all open set contained in A
\item[exterior]
	union of all open set disjoint from A
\item[boundary]
	points that are neither interior nor exterior
\item[limits] $f:A\subseteq X\to Y$\hfill\\
$f(x)\to y_0 \textrm{ as } x\to x_0$ if
$\forall \ \mathrm{open} \ V\ni y_0 \ \exists \ \mathrm{open} \ U\ni x_0 
	\ [x\in U\cap A \wedge x\neq x_0 \to f(x)\in V]$
\item[continuity] f is cts at $x_0$ if $x_0$ is isolated point or $(\lim_{x\to x_0}f(x)) = f(x_0)$
\item[Cauchy sequences] A sequences $\langle x_i\rangle$ is Cauchy if\hfill\\
	$\forall \varepsilon \exists N [n,m>N\implies |x_m-x_n|<\varepsilon]$
\item[completeness]
	A metric space $X$ is complete if every Cauchy sequences converge(to some point in $X$).
\item[compact sets]
	every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover
\item[connected sets]
	$X$ cannot be divided into two disjoint nonempty closed/open/clopen sets.
\item[relatively open sets] p26
	$A$ is relatively open in $Y\subseteq X$ if $\exists$ open $U\subseteq X$ such that $A=U\cap Y$
\item[Note] finite intersections and arbitrary unions of open set are open set
\item[Proposition] $f : X \to Y$ is cts iff $\forall$ open $ V \in Y$, $F^{-1}(V)$ is open in $X$. Similarly for closed.
\item[BW property] A subset $E \in \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies the BW property if every suquence has a convergent subsequence.
\item[BW theorem] $E \in \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies the BW property iff $E$ is closed and bounded.
\item[Heine-Borel theorem] $E \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is compact iff $E$ is closed and bounded.
\item[Application] Suppose $f:X \to Y$ is continuous and X is compact then $f(X)$ is compact
\item[Extreme value theorem] Suppose $f:X \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and X is compact then $\exists x_0 \in X$
such that $f(x) \leq f(x_0) \forall x \in X$.
\item[Path connected] A set $E$ is path connected if $\forall x, y \in E$, $\exists$ continuous
map $f:[a, b] \to E$ such that $f(a) = x$ and $f(b) = y$.
\item[Proposition] If $E$ is connected, and $f:E \to Y$ is continuous then $f(E)$ is connected
\item[Proposition] If $E$ is path connected then $E$ is connected.
\item[Intermediate Value Theorem] Suppose $E \in \mathbb{R}$ is connected and $f: E \to \mathbb{R}$
is continuous. Suppose $f(x) = a$ and $f(y) = b$ for some $x, y \in E$ and $a < b$.
Then $\forall a < c < b \exists$ some $z \in E$ such that $f(z) = c$.

General Comments: Should you memorize proofs of theorems? It is very hard to
memorize all proofs of all theorems. In the long run, it is much more efficient, as well
as useful and interesting, to first try to understand the proofs, and internalize the
methods of proof, as well as possible; then to remember just an outline of the proof,
or some key idea; roughly speaking, the minimum you would need to allow yourself
to reconstruct the proof out of your base of general knowledge/understanding.
Remember: it is important to know not simply whether something is true, but why
it is true.
