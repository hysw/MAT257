\TODO Thm 17.1 from Munkers is some what weird.

% somewhat weird
% \subsection{Change of variables theorem}
% Let $g:A \to B$ be a continuously differentiable ($\cC^1$) function,
% and $f:B \to \bR$ is continuous function then
% \fbox{$\int_B f=\int_a(g\circ g)\cdot g'$}.
% If $g$ is also a bijection, then \fbox{$\int_B f=\int_a(g\circ g)|\det Dg|$}.
% \extranote{$f$ is integrable over $B$ iff $(g\circ g)|\det Dg|$ is integrable over $A$}
